Unlocking Sales Insights: Power BI Dashboard for 'Food Mart'

I recently developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze Food Mart’s performance across key areas:
(Sales, Customer Satisfaction, and Inventory Distribution)

Key Focus Areas:                                                                                                                                                  
Total Sales & Avg. Sales                                                                                                                                  Item Performance                                                                                                                                            Customer Ratings                                                                                                                                                Outlet Insights

Core Visualizations:
1. Sales by Fat Content (Donut Chart) – Understand how nutritional content impacts sales.
2. Item Type Performance (Bar Chart) – Compare categories based on revenue and customer feedback.
3. Outlet-Wise Fat Content Sales (Stacked Column) – Visualize how different outlets perform across fat levels.
4. Sales by Establishment Year (Line Chart) – See how outlet age affects sales.
5. Outlet Size & Location Analysis (Pie & Map) – Explore spatial and size-based performance.
6. Full KPI Breakdown by Outlet Type (Matrix Card)

 Holistic view of all key metrics.
This dashboard helped identify high-performing products, outlet optimization opportunities, and customer preferences, all in a clean, interactive format.
